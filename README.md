# Mathematikon animations

This repository contains the apps for capturing the animations shown on the mirror screens in the Mathematikon building.
 
# Apps

- Whitney wheel: [Animate](whitney/index.html), [Capture](whitney/index.html?capture)
- In-and-out: [Animate](in-and-out/index.html), [Capture](in-and-out/index.html?capture)

# Notes

 - Google Chrome based web browser is recommended (for WebM capturing support via [CCapture.js](https://github.com/spite/ccapture.js)) 
 - If you are working with a HiDPI screen, the capture resolution might be off by the HiDPI scaling factor. In order to capture at the intended resolution, create an emulated device with a device pixel ratio of 1 and start the capture using this emulated device at the 100% zoom level.
