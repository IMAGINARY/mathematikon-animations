# Notes

 - Google Chrome based web browser is recommended (for WebM capturing support via [CCapture.js](https://github.com/spite/ccapture.js)) 
 - If you are working with a HiDPI screen, the capture resolution might be off by the HiDPI scaling factor. In order to capture at the intended resolution, create an emulated device with a device pixel ratio of 1 and start the capture using this emulated device at the 100% zoom level.
